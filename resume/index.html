<h3 id="neverfail-artisan-infrastructure">Neverfail (Artisan Infrastructure)</h3>
<p>*August 2013 – November 2016 | Cluj County, Romania</p>

<p>The company went through a lot of transitions in the last couple of years. Changing focus and building new products,
I was part of different teams focused on using new technologies that helped us implementing solutions regarding
network analysis and discovery, infrastructure automation, builing a cloud platform and big data analysis. 
I was responsible with software implementation and testing (mainly <strong>java</strong> with Spring but also a bit of C/C++,
bash, scala), maintenance of different systems and servers, automation and integration for a couple of external services.
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Projects at Neverfail that I worked on:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="architect">Architect</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The project is a network analysis and discovery tool that can keep track of
different hosts and applications on a given network. It is able to build 
dependecies between network traffic, Operating Systems and Applications.
I was responsible with research, implementation and building different 
dependecies for the project (winexe, nmap, OVA appliance).
<br />
<strong>Worked with: Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Nmap, pcap, winexe, OVA Appliances, Netapp</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="virtual-private-datacenter">Virtual Private Datacenter</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This project was focused on automating the deployment of new hardware and products 
in our datacenters. I had to work with mutiple external services, integrate with their
APIs, write automation solutions described by the sales and hardware team.
<br />
<strong>Worked with: Agile-Scrum Methodologies, Java, Spring Web, Spring Boot, HATEOAS REST APIs</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="cloud-service-architect">Cloud Service Architect</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Following the previous project, this one was focused on exposing the hardware from datacenters 
to clients through a web platform. The whole project was based on microservice architecture, Docker
and Rancher as a Container Orchestration tool. I worked with different teams and during the project
I was responsible for some of the services in the platform, Rancher Orchestration server, 
deployment architecture, continous delivery and maintenance of the production environment.
<br />
<strong>Worked with: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Rest APIs, Salesforce Integration, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,</strong>
<strong>ActiveMQ, Rancher, Docker, Jenkins, GoCD</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="data-driven-services---billing">Data Driven Services - Billing</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In order to be able to bill every hardware usage from the company, this project was designed to
gather all the required information from the infrastructure, aggregate all the data and build an
invoice for all the clients. Together with a team, I worked on collecting the data and save it to 
Cassandra, writting aggregation algorithms using the data from Cassandra and Apache Spark.
Also we had to research best practises for deploying Cassandra and Spark into a production environment
and find the best deployment methods that suited our needs. 
<br />
<strong>Worked with: Java8, Spring Boot, Immutables, Functional Programming (in Java and a bit in Scala),</strong>
<strong>Cassandra, Apache Spark, ActiveMQ</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
