# Experience

### Neverfail (Artisan Infrastructure)
*August 2013 – November 2016 | Cluj County, Romania

The company went through a lot of transitions in the last couple of years. Changing focus and building new products,
I was part of different teams focused on using new technologies that helped us implementing solutions regarding
network analysis and discovery, infrastructure automation, builing a cloud platform and big data analysis. 
I was responsible with software implementation and testing (mainly **java** with Spring but also a bit of C/C++,
bash, scala), maintenance of different systems and servers, automation and integration for a couple of external services.
<br/>

**Projects at Neverfail that I worked on:**

* #### Architect
> The project is a network analysis and discovery tool that can keep track of
> different hosts and applications on a given network. It is able to build 
> dependecies between network traffic, Operating Systems and Applications.
> I was responsible with research, implementation and building different 
> dependecies for the project (winexe, nmap, OVA appliance).
<br/>
> **Worked with: Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Nmap, pcap, winexe, OVA Appliances, Netapp**

* #### Virtual Private Datacenter
> This project was focused on automating the deployment of new hardware and products 
> in our datacenters. I had to work with mutiple external services, integrate with their
> APIs, write automation solutions described by the sales and hardware team.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Agile-Scrum Methodologies, Java, Spring Web, Spring Boot, HATEOAS REST APIs**

* #### Cloud Service Architect
> Following the previous project, this one was focused on exposing the hardware from datacenters 
> to clients through a web platform. The whole project was based on microservice architecture, Docker
> and Rancher as a Container Orchestration tool. I worked with different teams and during the project
> I was responsible for some of the services in the platform, Rancher Orchestration server, 
> deployment architecture, continous delivery and maintenance of the production environment.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Rest APIs, Salesforce Integration, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,**
> **ActiveMQ, Rancher, Docker, Jenkins, GoCD**

* #### Data Driven Services - Billing
> In order to be able to bill every hardware usage from the company, this project was designed to
> gather all the required information from the infrastructure, aggregate all the data and build an
> invoice for all the clients. Together with a team, I worked on collecting the data and save it to 
> Cassandra, writting aggregation algorithms using the data from Cassandra and Apache Spark.
> Also we had to research best practises for deploying Cassandra and Spark into a production environment
> and find the best deployment methods that suited our needs. 
<br/>
> **Worked with: Java8, Spring Boot, Immutables, Functional Programming (in Java and a bit in Scala),**
> **Cassandra, Apache Spark, ActiveMQ**

### PitechPlus
*January 2017 – March 2017 | Cluj County, Romania

Worked with AWS and CI/CD solutions for different projects.
<br/>

### iQuate Ltd.
*April 2017 – Present | Cluj County, Romania

The company is focused on building a platform that scans and then analyses 
data coming from infrastructure in different datacenters.I am currently 
working on the project that takes care of the second part.
<br/>

* #### HADM
> Microservice platform written in Scala and using Akka Framework (mostly) that analyses the data regarding
> infrastructure. My main focus is the communication between the platform and the component that sends data from 
> datacenters, the deployment of the required services (Kubernetes on Bare Metal, Kafka, Cassandra) and CI/CD.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Scala, Akka, Play, Kubernetes, AWS**
