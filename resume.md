# Experience

### Neverfail (Artisan Infrastructure)
*March 2013 – Present | Cluj County, Romania

The company went through a lot of transitions in the last couple of years. Chaging focus and building new products,
I was part of different teams focused on using new technologies that helped us implementing solutions regarding
network analysis and discovery, infrastructure automation, builing a cloud platform and big data analysis. 
I was responsible with software implementation and testing (mainly **java** with Spring but also a bit of C/C++,
bash, scala), maintenance of different systems and servers, automation and integration for a couple of external services.
<br/>

**Projects at Neverfail that I worked on:**

* #### Architect
> The project is a network analysis and discovery tool that can keep track of
> different hosts and applications on a given network. It is able to build 
> dependecies between network traffic, Operating Systems and Applications.
> I was responsible with research, implementation and building different 
> dependecies for the project (winexe, nmap, OVA appliance).
<br/>
> **Worked with: Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Nmap, pcap, winexe, OVA Appliances, Netapp**

* #### Virtual Private Datacenter
> This project was focused on automating the deployment of new hardware and products 
> in our datacenters. I had to work with mutiple external services, integrate with their
> APIs, write automation solutions described by the sales and hardware team.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Agile-Scrum Methodologies, Java, Spring Web, Spring Boot, HATEOAS REST APIs**
