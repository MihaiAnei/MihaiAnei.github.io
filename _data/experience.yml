  position: DevOps
  duration: July, 2018 &mdash; March, 2020
  summary: >
    I worked with an SRE team on adopting Kubernetes throughout the company and improving the general state of the infrastructure,
    which was based on AWS. At the same time I worked embedded in many development teams and helped with their immediate necessities which
    made me being involved in some design decisions for the systems we made. Some of the work I did was improving aspects of development
    lifecycle but not only that:
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
    <li>CI and release with GitLab</li>
    <li>Automating integration/performance tests with GitLab and K8S</li>
    <li>Technology adoption requirements</li>
    <li>CD with GitOps (ArgoCD)</li>
    <li>Performance tuning with Celery</li>
    <li>Debugging production issues with dev team members</li>
    </ul>
    At the same time I was focusing with the SRE team on designing and implementing the same set of toolings and infrastructure throughout all our AWS accounts.
    We reffered to this as a development and production release platform developers can use without too much of our help:
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
    <li>Same AWS EKS configuration and access</li>
    <li>Prometheus Operator for monitoring</li>
    <li>FluentD, FluentBit and ElasticSearch stack for Logging and Application Monitoring</li>
    <li>Strimzi Operator for Kafka</li>
    <li>Introduced Elastic APM</li>
    <li>Automation and maintenance around MongoDB (core part of the platform)</li>
    </ul>

    I was mainly a part of a project called HADM, a microservice platform written in Scala and using Akka Framework
    (mostly) that analyses the data regarding infrastructure. My main focus was the communication between the platform
    and the component that sends data from datacenters. I was also involved with the deployment of the required services
    (Kubernetes on Bare Metal, Kafka, Cassandra) and CI/CD.
